### Task 1: Array Manipulation in JavaScript
Objective: Create a function called processArray to handle an array of numbers.

Description:
- The function should loop through the array.
- If a number is even, it should be squared.
- If a number is odd, it should be tripled.
- The function should return the newly processed array.

### Task 2: Formatting Array Strings
Objective: Define a function named formatArrayStrings in the same JavaScript file.

Description:
- The function should accept two arrays: one containing strings and another containing corresponding numbers.
- It should combine each string with its corresponding number.
- The combined format should place the number after the string.
- The function should return a new array with these formatted strings.

### Task 3: Creating User Profiles
Objective: Create a new file named userInfo.js and implement a function createUserProfiles.

Description:
- This function should take two arrays: one with original names and one with modified names (from Task 2).
- It should generate an array of objects, where each object represents a user profile.
- Each user profile should include:
  - originalName: the name from the original names array.
  - modifiedName: the corresponding name from the modified names array.
  - id: a unique identifier that starts from 1 and increments for each profile.
